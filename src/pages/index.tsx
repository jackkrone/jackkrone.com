        Welcome to my personal site. I created this site to share ideas that are
        too long for a twitter thread. By sharing some insights and learnings
        publicly, I hope to think and communicate more clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you notice any mistakes or you disagree with something Iâ€™ve written,
        please <Link to="/connect">reach out</Link> and let me know. My opinions
        are all works in progress.
