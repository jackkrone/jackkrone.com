      If commodity prices continue to rise throughout the year, I think
      there&#39;s a good chance that lower consumer purchasing power or
      preemptive Fed rate action to combat inflation will limit spending and
      consumer confidence and wreck the economic recovery

Back in late 2020 and early 2021, stagflation concerns cropped up as commodity prices climbed in the wake of federal stimulus.
Now, inflation is hitting its highest rate in the US since the early 1980s.
It stood at 8.3% in April's [consumer price index report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/cpi_05112022.htm).
As prices have risen, [savings rates](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT) have dropped below pre-pandemic levels to a 13.5 year low [Figure 1].
[Real wages](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881600Q#0) have also dropped below pre-pandemic levels.

The President and the Federal Reserve have been vocal about getting inflation under control.
But in my opinion, one of the more unlikely scenarios over the next 6 months to 2 years is that a combination of competent fiscal and monetary policy will achieve low inflation while preserving positive economic growth.
In other words, I think it's likely that there will remain at least one downward pressure on consumer spending power, whether it be high inflation or a contracting economy.

More specifically: while the world's largest economy is raising rates, the world's largest manufacturer (China) is regularly preventing swaths of its population from working, and world's largest energy exporter (Russia) is locked into a war in Europe.
Note that Russia and Ukraine are also Europe's first and second largest food producers.
The Fed's approach to slow inflation slows the economy without directly addressing global supply-side price pressure on energy, goods, and food.
This increases the risk of stagflation. It's reasonable to assume that in the near-term future either the US economy will contract, inflation will continue to run hot, or both.

Regardless of the true risk level of recession and/or persistantly high inflation, Americans are concerned about both (see [here](https://apnews.com/press-release/business-wire/inflation-economy-economic-outlook-422640693dc041a6bb8c09758087d6c2) and [here](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/economic-issues-top-publics-agenda-poll/story?id=85183412)), and this perception could be enough to drive consumption patterns.
As a result, I'm investing in discount retailers.
I'm betting that these businesses will do well as long as consumer spending power is declining.
With limited time and attention to select the optimal investments, my strategy is to invest evenly in Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG).
If you're interested in making a similar bet, the Canadian chain Dollarama is also worthy of consideration.

### Other considerations

##### Upside potential

Discount retailers are a fairly obvious bet for investors concerned about declining spending power. They have potential to become meme stocks.

##### Downside potential

Discount retailers are a fairly obvious bet for investors concerned about declining consumer spending power, so some of the upside is probably already priced in. Two weeks ago, the share values of Dollar Tree and Dollar General popped about 20% each in response to [increased sales forecasts](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/dollar-general-raises-annual-sales-forecast-2022-05-26) in their quarterly earnings reports.
