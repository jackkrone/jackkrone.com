      If commodity prices continue to rise throughout the year, I think
      there&#39;s a good chance that lower consumer purchasing power or
      preemptive Fed rate action to combat inflation will limit spending and
      consumer confidence and wreck the economic recovery

US inflation is at its highest rate since the early 1980s. It stood at 8.3% in April's [consumer price index report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But to most Americans it likely feels higher. Since June of 2020, Gasoline prices are up [134%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GASREGW/#0), vehicle prices are up [26%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUSR0000SETA), and home prices, although not included in the CPI, are up [27%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USSTHPI). As prices have risen, Americans' [savings rates](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT) have dropped below pre-pandemic levels to a 13.5 year low [Figure 1]. [Real wages](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881600Q#0) have also dropped below pre-pandemic levels.

The President and the Federal Reserve have been vocal about getting inflation under control. But over the course of the next 6 months to 2 years, I think one of the more unlikely scenarios is that a combination of competent fiscal and monetary policy will achieve both of the following: tamping down inflation and preserving positive economic growth. In other words, I think it's likely that there will remain at least one strong downward pressure on consumer spending power, whether it be high inflation or a contracting economy.

Additionally, regardless of the actual risk of recession or continued high inflation, Americans are concerned about both (see [here](https://apnews.com/press-release/business-wire/inflation-economy-economic-outlook-422640693dc041a6bb8c09758087d6c2) and [here](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/economic-issues-top-publics-agenda-poll/story?id=85183412)), and this perception should drive consumption patterns to some extent. As a result, it may be an opportune time to invest in discount retailers. I think they will likely do well as long as consumer spending power is declining. With limited time and attention to select the optimal investments, my strategy is to invest evenly in Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG).

### Other considerations

##### Upside potential

Discount retailers are a fairly obvious bet for investors concerned about declining spending power. They have potential to become meme stocks.

##### Downside potential

Discount retailers are a fairly obvious bet for investors concerned about declining consumer spending power, so some of the upside is probably already priced in. Two weeks ago, the share values of Dollar Tree and Dollar General popped about 20% each in response to [increased sales forecasts](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/dollar-general-raises-annual-sales-forecast-2022-05-26) in their quarterly earnings reports.
