*Note: I wrote this piece in February 2021, before I had this site up and running. Investing at its worst is an extremely impulsive endeavor. To counteract this tendency, I often force myself to clearly articulate my investment rationale before putting money on the line. This document is one such example. Now, in October 2021, it makes me appear particularly insightful. But of course I'm only posting this after the investment has begun to pay off. In the future I will post some of my investment theses at the time I write them in order to put a little extra skin in the game.*

## Summary

Invest with margin in natural gas producers and pipeline operators that have high dividend yields and a consistent dividend history. Investment timeline: 2-10 years.

### A. Natural Gas isn’t going anywhere

Barring technological breakthrough in energy storage, intermittent energy producers such as solar and wind will be inadequate as a primary energy source. Fossil fuels will still be required to properly power the US electric grid. All things considered, natural gas is cleaner to burn than oil or coal. In a logical world it will prove to be the preferred fossil fuel.

* Update 2020.02.15: An unusually cold week knocked out half of all wind power in Texas while electricity and gas demand rose, presumably for heating homes.

### B. US electricity demand will increase significantly & natural gas will naturally fill the gap

As US transitions to electric vehicles, total US electricity demand will increase as crude demand decreases, unless crude is burned for electric power. Furthermore, I think that estimates for the adoption rate of renewables are probably too optimistic. With coal currently in decline due to extraction and regulation costs, and oil production likely to decline in the more distant future, natural gas will directly fill the supply gap created by lower coal production for electric power and will indirectly fill the supply gap created by lower oil production. When offshore (and onshore, to some extent) oil wells are shuttered it will tighten the supply of natural gas, causing short term upward pressure on gas prices that will increase natural gas producers’ valuations. This upward pressure may be negated by increased supply from onshore fracking.

Figure 1: This image gives an indication of how natural gas is poised to steal power generation market share from coal, and especially so with the help of clean power policies.

### D. The Biden Administration’s executive actions will increase natural gas prices

In the short term (5 years) the risk of significant increases in the rollout of renewable energy production is low. Banning drilling on federal lands and canceling pipeline construction will constrain supply and cause natural gas prices to increase. This will be good for natural gas producers valuations. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland may extend Biden’s temporary ban on fossil fuel leasing on federal lands. Regardless, these bans do not revoke current leases, which last 3-4 years for onshore and 7-10 years for offshore, meaning many leases may outlive the Biden administration. Note that the Secretary of energy Jennifer Granholm does not appear hostile toward natural gas. Also note: an extra cautious strategy would focus on producers and pipelines that do not have significant reliance on federal lands. Current sources show that only around a quarter of oil and of has production each takes place on federal lands.

### C. Oil and Gas stocks have relatively low valuations

Assuming a return to profitability for many oil and gas producers by the end of 2021, valuations in the sector are significantly lower than the market as a whole following the economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic. I believe valuations may also be artificially depressed by anti-fossil-fuel-industry sentiment among investors, the general public, and the Democratic Party, which holds the Presidency and majority power in both chambers of congress.

### D. Investment in natural gas exploration has stalled

Since the beginning of the pandemic, and possibly as early as 2014 (natural gas prices have been considerably lower since then), producers have shifted capital from exploration to paying down debt and returning to free cash flow generation. This is happening as OPEC+ is simultaneously propping up prices by cutting production.

Figure 2: Right now, the industry has experienced depressed valuation, taken supply off, and diminished capital expenditures.

### D. Now is a good time to own wealth-producing debt

The Fed has explicitly stated it’s heightened tolerance for inflation in coming years. It has also dropped its use of explicit inflation targets. I believe the purpose of this is so that the US government can pay down the debt it has incurred as a result of pandemic spending. The Fed utilized the same strategy in the post-war period, often tolerating extremely high inflation in the name of decreasing the cost of the federal debt.

### Upside potentials

* Biden admin takes explicit softer tact toward natural gas, including it in its energy transition plans and communicating to the public why natural gas is a preferable fossil fuel energy source
* The EU takes a more explicit stance in favor of natural gas as a transitional fuel
* More use of natural gas as vehicle fuel. See Amazon.

### Downside potentials

* Technological breakthrough in energy storage that makes renewables more competitive
* Common sense deregulation of nuclear energy
* Company-specific meltdown due to poor management, unforeseen liabilities, or other factors
  * Hedge: Choosea minimum of three different natural gas companies to invest in
* Market-wide meltdown
  * Hedge: Gold or bitcoin
* Biden Administration takes a more hostile tact toward natural gas

### Criteria

* Three natural gas companies focused on production or pipelines
* Cumulative dividend payments cover margin costs (Current margin rates are between 1.5% and 4% compounded daily)
* All three companies do not need to pay a dividend

### Bonus criteria

* Companies that are focused on Marcellus shale as it is not on federal lands and would require state-wide bans on fracking (see New York state) or action by congress (unlikely) in order to ban or tax fracking in a way that will significantly hurt producers.
* Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana shale should also be good for the same reasons. Barnett shale in Texas is not on federal land. In New Mexico it is.
